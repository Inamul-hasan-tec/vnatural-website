# VNatural Website - Setup Instructions

## 🌿 Welcome to VNatural

This is a comprehensive Next.js website for VNatural - a next-generation wellness ecosystem integrating natural products, medical support, AI technology, and personalized nutrition.

## 📋 Quick Setup

### 1. Save the Hero Background Image

1. Locate the nature waterfall image you uploaded (the one with waterfalls, blue water, green trees, and mountains)
2. Save it to: `C:\Users\User\CascadeProjects\vnatural-website\public\hero-nature.jpg`
3. Make sure the filename is exactly `hero-nature.jpg`

### 2. Start the Development Server

The server should already be running. If not, run:
